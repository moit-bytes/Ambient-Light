# Ambient-Light
Darkness creates problems and to avoid darkness we need light and on the same idea my project works on.
If the photoresistor(or LDR) senses dim light or no light in the room then it automically sends a feed(data) to our microcontroller.
In my case I used Arduino Uno R3 which receives the feed from the sensor and glows the led.
A brief description of the hardware and the running code is mentioned in this repo.
